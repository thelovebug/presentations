# presentations

This is my repository for presentations created with [Marp](https://marp.app/).

## Dependencies

This requires `marp-cli` to be installed:

> `npm install -G @marp-team/marp-cli`

I suppose it's possible to run this within a node project, but I know naff all about that

## Directory structure

- `scripts/` contains scripts for converting `.md` files to `.html` and also for compiling templates from snippets

- `slidedeck/` contains sources and rendered slidedecks
  `.md` files are the original sources
  `.html` and `.pdf` files will be rendered versions of the originals.

- `snippets/` contains a whole bunch of reusable slide snippets which can be used to make templates as a starting point for a slidedeck

## Yep, this sucks

I appreciate that this repo contains a lot of rendered stuff - part of this is laziness on my part as I can present the `.html` files directly within GitHub.  This makes the reusablity of this repo slightly difficult.  That having been said, all contributions considered.
